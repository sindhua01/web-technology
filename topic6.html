<h3>client-server technology:

<br>*What is Client-Server Technology?*<br>
<br>Client-server technology is a distributed computing model where one or more clients request services or resources from a central server. The server provides the requested services or resources, and the client receives and processes the response.

<br>*Key Components:*<br>
<br>1. *Client*: A device or software application that requests services or resources from the server.
<br>2. *Server*: A device or software application that provides services or resources to the client.
<br>3. *Network*: A communication infrastructure that connects the client and server.

<br>*How Client-Server Technology Works:*<br>
<br>1. *Request*: The client sends a request to the server for a service or resource.
<br>2. *Processing*: The server processes the request, authenticates the client, and retrieves the requested resource.
<br>3. *Response*: The server sends a response back to the client, including the requested resource.
<br>4. *Receipt*: The client receives the response and processes the requested resource.

<br>*Types of Client-Server Architectures:*<br>
<br>1. *One-Tier Architecture*: The client and server are combined into a single device or application.
<br>2. *Two-Tier Architecture*: The client and server are separate devices or applications, with the client requesting services from the server.
<br>3. *Three-Tier Architecture*: The client, server, and database are separate devices or applications, with the client requesting services from the server, which in turn requests data from the database.
<br>4. *N-Tier Architecture*: A multi-tier architecture with multiple layers of servers and databases.

<br>*Advantages:*<br>
<br>1. *Scalability*: Client-server technology allows for scalability, as new clients and servers can be added as needed.
<br>2. *Flexibility*: Client-server technology provides flexibility, as clients and servers can be located anywhere and communicate over a network.
<br>3. *Security*: Client-server technology provides security, as the server can authenticate clients and control access to resources.
<br>4. *Maintenance*: Client-server technology provides maintenance benefits, as servers can be updated and maintained centrally.

<br>*Disadvantages:*<br>
<br>1. *Complexity*: Client-server technology can be complex to implement and manage.
<br>2. *Cost*: Client-server technology can be expensive to implement and maintain.
<br>3. *Dependence on Server*: Clients depend on the server for services and resources, which can be a single point of failure.
<br>4. *Network Congestion*: Client-server technology can lead to network congestion, as multiple clients request services from the server.
